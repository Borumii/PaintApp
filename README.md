# PaintApp
Paint application developed in Java as a personal project to learn about how to use Java swing, among other things. Implementation of many features included, as well as documentation of the code's functions.

I'm satisfied with what I was able to do over the break (this was built over Christmas), but had I had more time I would have liked to modularize this a bit as it's all just one big file at the moment. I was also planning on adding more features like a seperate menu containing polygons, an option to dynamically add and remove layers, rename them, etc, but I was unable to get to it before school started again. 

PaintApp.java is raw text; lessons folder contains the program.
